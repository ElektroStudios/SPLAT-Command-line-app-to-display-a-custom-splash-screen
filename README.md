# SPLAT - Command-line app to display a custom splash screen 

### SPLAT can be used to show a splash screen, that is, to display an image for a short period of time before starting a external program.

The main idea behind **SPLAT** is to use it as part of any **WinRar** or similar self-extracting files, Batch-script files, a post-installation process of installer builders like Inno Setup, etc, to customize your packaging.

This is an old project, with ugly source-code, and probably I will not rewrite it using good and modern habbits.
